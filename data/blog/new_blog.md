Trying out the minimalistic CMS [urubu]. Look!

# This is a `<h1>` tag
Good for starting a page or perhaps GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!

## This is a `<h2>` tag
I am quite new to this markdown even though I have used it in the past.

###### This is a `<h6>` tag
[bootstrap] is a real gift to people like me that fail hard at CSS.

### Emphasis
*This text will be italic.* _This will also be italic._ **This text will be bold.** __This will also be bold.__ *You **can** combine them.*

### Images
![Alt Text](//bluesnake.snakedesert.se/images/rar.gif)

### Links
It's nice to keep the data over at [GitHub](http://github.com) so you can publish stuff from anywhere. Even if we rarely will be doing that, publish that is.

### Quotes
As Kurt Cobain said:

> I like to complain and do nothing 
> to make things better.

### Inline code
I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

### Code blocks
```python
import sys
print "hello world!"
sys.exit()
```
